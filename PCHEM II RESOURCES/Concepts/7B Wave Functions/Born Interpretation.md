If a [[Wavefunction]] of a particle has the value psi at x, then the probability of finding the particle between x and x +dx is proportional to |psi|^2 dx. (See [[Equation Sheet]] for more details!)

What are the cons of this?
Psi cannot be infinite over a finte region.
Cannot have more than one value of |psi| ^2 at one single point.

The wavefunction must be single-valued!
