**11. Consider the 4 reversible steps of the Carnot cycle for a steam engine.
For each step (no explanations needed!): (i) state the nature of the transformation (in just two words); (ii) indicate whether the engine transfers heat to the surroundings [q<0], or gains heat from the surroundings [q>0], or whether there is no heat transfer [q=0]; (iii) indicate whether the engine does pV work against the surroundings [w<0], or the surroundings does work on the engine [w>0], or whether no work is involved [w=0]; and (iv) indicate whether the engine is connected to a cold heat reservoir, or to a hot heat reservoir, or is not connected to any heat reservoir.
