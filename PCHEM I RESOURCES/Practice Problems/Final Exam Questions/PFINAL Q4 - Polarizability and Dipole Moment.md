**4. Consider methane, CH4, and its following derivatives:
A = methane
B = dichloromethane
C = tetraiodomethane
D = (mono)chloro(mono)iodomethane
E = diodomethane
a). Rank the 5 molecules in the order of decreasing polarizability. Explain your ranking. (8 pts.)**
C, D, E, B, A

Polarizability, the ease with which an electron cloud of a molecule is distorted, is inversely proportional to the number of electrons (ie size of the e cloud). CDE all contain a decreasing amount of I, which has a greater number of e shells compared to Cl or C.

**b). Rank the 5 molecules in the order of increasing permanent dipole moment. Explain your ranking. (8 pts.)**
A, C, B, D, E

The permanent dipole of a molecule depends on the number of e and its symmetry. A and C are both symmetrical about the central C, however C has more e due to I. B,D,E all have asymmetrical distributions of their electronegative atoms, and increase based on the number of I - which have more electrons.
