**3. A biochemist has prepared a solution that is 0.05 M in hemoglobin and 0.05 M in glucose.
Determine the osmotic pressure of that solution at 25ÂºC and express it both in J.L-1 and in bar.

What is the equation for [[Osmotic Pressure]]? Similar to [[E3 Q7 - Osmotic Pressure of Solution]] [[PSS 6 Q3 - Calculating Osmotic Pressure]] 
pipi = iCRT
How would you do this for two solutes? 
We find the total concentration, which in this case is 0.10M ?
pipi = 2.5 kJ / mol x 0.10 mol / L
pipi = 2500 x 0.10 J / L = 250 J / L

How to convert to bar?
You divide by 100 - so 0.25 bar!
