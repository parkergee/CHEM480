**9. Given that the force exerted by a spring elongated over a distance Z corresponds to -kZ (where k represents the spring constant), express the mechanical potential energy stored in the spring upon such an elongation: (4 pts.)**

**Stored mechanical energy at elongation Z =** 
F = -kZ 
E = -int-kZ = +kZ^2

**b). An ideal gas expands isothermally from a volume V to a volume 2V. Express the variation in internal energy of the gas corresponding to this expansion: (4 pts.)
ΔU =** dqrev + dwrev
dU is zero
dqrev =  TdS
dwrev = -pdV

**c). Consider the Helmholtz free energy A and write its variation dA with respect to its natural variables (when assuming a fixed composition of the system, reversible conditions, and only pV work - do not provide the full derivation, which you may carry out on the back of the page):**
What are the natural variables of Helmholtz?
Volume and Temperature
**dA =** -pdV - SdT

**d). Considering a substance X involved in the chemical reaction X ⇄ Y, give the definition of the chemical potential for X: (6 pts.)
Is the partial free energy of a molecule X
μX =** dG/dX

**e). Explain briefly what is meant by surface tension: (8 pts.)**
The tension of the surface film of a liquid caused by the attraction of the particles in the surface layer by the bulk of the liquid, which tends to minimize surface area
