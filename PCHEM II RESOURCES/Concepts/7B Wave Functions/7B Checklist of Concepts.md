☐ 1. A wavefunction is a mathematical function that con-tains all the dynamical information about a system.
☐ 2. The Schrödinger equation is a second-order differential equation used to calculate the wavefunction of a system.
☐ 3. According to the Born interpretation, the probability density at a point is proportional to the square of the wavefunction at that point.
☐ 4. A node is a point where a wavefunction passes through zero.
☐ 5. A wavefunction is normalized if the integral over all space of its square modulus is equal to 1.
☐ 6. A wavefunction must be single-valued, continuous, not infinite over a finite region of space, and (except in special cases) have a continuous slope.
☐ 7. The quantization of energy stems from the constraints that an acceptable wavefunction must satisfy.
