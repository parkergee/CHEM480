**8. The decomposition of a pure substance R is determined experimentally to occur in solution in a single elementary step:**

**R â€”> S + T

**a). Write the rate law for this reaction. (4 pts.)

-dR/dt = kR
lnRt = LnR0 - kt

**b). Knowing that it has taken 1 hour for the concentration in R to come down from 0.8 M to 0.2M, determine how much longer it will take for this concentration to come down to 0.1 M.

What is the halflife of a first order reaction?
k = s-1
Find k
Then use t1/2 = ln2/k
(Answer is 30minutes)

What is ln2? = 0.7  and ln10 = 2.3
