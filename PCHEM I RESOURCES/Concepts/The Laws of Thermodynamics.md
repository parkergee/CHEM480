The first law of thermodynamics statesÂ _that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred_. U = q +w
The second law states, for a spontaneous process the entropy of the universe increases
Suniv + S sys >= 0
The third law of thermodynamics **the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero** as the number of configs decreases
S = kBlogW
