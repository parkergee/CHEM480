The quantitative version of [[The Uncertainty Principle]] :
![[Pasted image 20230304140254.png]]
Delta pq is the uncertainty in the linear momentum parallel to the axis q. 
Delta q is the uncertainty in the position along the axis q.

How do we find these uncertainties? 
- They are given by the root-mean-square deviations of the observables from their mean value.

- If there is complete certainty in the position, Delta q = 0
Then, the only way to satisfy the above is when Delta pq = inf+

Same way vice versa with momentum complete certainty.

NOTE! p and q refer to the same direction in space (ie the momentum in x-axis and postion in x-axis).
