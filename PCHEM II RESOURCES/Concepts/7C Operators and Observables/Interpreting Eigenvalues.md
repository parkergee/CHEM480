In the case of the Kinetic Energy operator:

Note that the second derivative is a measure of curvature, a large second derivative means there is a sharp curvature. A sharply curved wavefunction is associated with a high kinetic energy and one with a low curvature is associated with a low kinetic energy.

Wherever a wavefunction is sharply curved, its contribution to the total kinetic energy is large; wherever the wavefunction is not sharply curved, its contribu-tion to the overall kinetic energy is low. 

The observed kinetic energy of a particle is an overage of all the contribution os the kinetic energy from each region.

Therefore, a particle will have a high KE if the average curvature of the wavefunction is high.
