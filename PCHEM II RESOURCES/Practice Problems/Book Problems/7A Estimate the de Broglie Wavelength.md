**Estimate the wavelength of electrons that have been accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 40 kV**

Collect your thoughts To use the de Broglie relation, you need to know the linear momentum, p, of the electrons. To calcu-late the linear momentum, note that the energy acquired by an electron accelerated through a potential difference Δφ is eΔφ, where e is the magnitude of its charge. At the end of the period of acceleration, all the acquired energy is in the form of kinetic energy, Ek culate p by setting p2
= 1 2 mev2 = p2 /2me. You can therefore calculate p by setting p^2/wm equal to edeltaphi.

1VC = 1J and 1J = 1kg,^2s^-2
