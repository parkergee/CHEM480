**8. The decomposition of a pure substance R is determined experimentally to occur in solution in a single elementary step:**
**R â€”> S + T
a). Write the rate law for this reaction. (4 pts.)
b). Knowing that it has taken 1 hour for the concentration in R to come down from 0.8 M to 0.2M, determine how much longer it will take for this concentration to come down to 0.1 M.
