**10. The reaction: A (g) + B (g) â‡„ 2C (g) occurs between real (non-ideal) gases. It turns out that the conditions of pressure and temperature under which the reaction takes place are such that, at equilibrium, the partial pressures in A, B, and C are all equal.**

**Write the equilibrium constant of the reaction:**

**a) as a function of the activities of each substance at equilibrium: (4 pts.)**

**K =** aC^2 / aA aB

**b) as a function of the activities expressed in terms of the activity coefficients and partial pressures at equilibrium (consider how you can simplify the expression by taking into account the values of the partial pressures at equilibrium): (4 pts.)**
a = activity coeff * partial pressure, in ideal conditions it is just 1 so we can just use the partial pressures!!! Where initial pressure is just 1 bar

**K =** PC^2 / PA PB
