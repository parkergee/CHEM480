Your answer:
For finding the molar mass of a compound using Raoults Law (the proprtion of new to old pressure)
You first find the molar fraction of the solvent
Then you find the mols of solvent you have (nA)
Then you find the mols of solute using the molar fraction of solvent
Then you divide the mass you added by the mols
