**5. Consider a system made of four sub-systems that are in thermal equilibrium. Each subsystem has 5 non-degenerate energy levels with quantized energies:
 E0 = 0; E1 = ε; E2 = 3ε; E3 = 4ε; and E4 = 6ε. the energy levels of the four subsystems and illustrate the energy distribution that is the least probable. (8 pts.)

**b). Sketch the energy levels of the four subsystems and illustrate an example of the energy distribution that is the most probable. (8 pts.)**
