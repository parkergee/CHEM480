Three experiments carried out near the ends of the 19th energy led to the view that energy can be transferred in only discrete amounts.

1. [[Black-Body Radiation]] - The limitation of energiesto discrete values. Leads to the [[Planck Distribution]]:

Avoids ultraviolet catastrophe - E density goes to 0 as wavelength descreases due to it being bound to an exponential.

How does temperature affect the proportion of radiation wavelength?

2. Heat Capacity
century had shown that at room temperature the molar heat capacities of many monatomic solids are about 3R, where R is the gas constant.1
However, when measurements were made at
much lower temperatures it was found that the heat capacity decreased, tending to zero as the temperature approached zero. Classical physics was unable to explain this temperature de-=
pendence.

Einstein showed that when you applied planck's constant to show thatan oscillating atom could have an energy nhv.

Showed that using the Boltzmann distribution, each oscillator is unlikely to be excited to new energies. At low temo, few oscillators can be excited at all.

3.  Atomic and Molecular Spectra
This observation can be under-stood if the energy of the atoms or molecules is also confined to discrete values, because then the energies that a molecule can discard or acquire are also confined to discrete values (Fig. 7A.8). If the energy of an atom or molecule decreases by ΔE, and this energy is carried away as radiation, the frequency of the radiation ν and the change in energy are related by the Bohr frequency condition:
ΔE = hν
