- No electrons are ejected, regardless of the intensity of the radiation, unless its frequency exceeds a threshold value characteristic of the metal.
• The kinetic energy of the ejected electrons increases lin-early with the frequency of the incident radiation but is independent of the intensity of the radiation.
• Even at low radiation intensities, electrons are ejected immediately if the frequency is above the threshold value.
eV = 1.602 × 10−19 J

- Photoejection cannot occur if hν < Φ because the photon brings insufficient energy.
• The kinetic energy of an ejected electron increases lin-early with the frequency of the photon.
• When a photon collides with an electron, it gives up all its energy, so electrons should appear as soon as the colli-sions begin, provided the photons have sufficient energy
