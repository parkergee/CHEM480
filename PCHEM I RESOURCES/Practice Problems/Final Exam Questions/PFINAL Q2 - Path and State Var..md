[[Path and State Variables]]
**2a). Explain the difference between state and path variables. (4 pts.)**
A path variable only depends on the state of the system, and not how it achieved this state. A path variable depends on the history of the system.
**b). Give two examples of thermodynamic path variables. (4 pts.)**
Internal energy, pressure, volume, temperature
**c). Give two examples of thermodynamic state variables. (4 pts.)**
heat, work
