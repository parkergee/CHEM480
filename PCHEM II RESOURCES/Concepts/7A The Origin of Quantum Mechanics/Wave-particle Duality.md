1. The particle character of electromagnetic radiation.

Planck's black-body radiation led to oscillator freq can only be descrete energies 0, hv, 2hv. 

Led to the thought that ER at that frequency contained 0,1,2 particles - photons.

Oscillator of v is in 1st excited state - one photon is present.

2. The wave character of particles.
- Germer Diffraction, Thompson experiments. de Broglie equation suggested that any particle with linear momentum should have a wavelength.
