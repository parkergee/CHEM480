If the position is known precisely, then the momentum cannot be predicted. 

If the position is known, and at a definite location, then its wavefunction is LARGE there and 0 EVERYWHERE else.

You can create this wavfunction by superimposing a large number of sine and cosine function or a number of e^-x functions.

A sharply localized wavefunction is called a wavepacket. It becomes sharper due to the interference between positive and negative regions of the individual waves.

Once it reaches infinity, the particle is perfectly localized but all the information about its momentum has been lost.

The measurement of momentum will give a result corresponding to any one of the infinite number of waves in the superposition.
