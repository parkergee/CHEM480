Kinetics:
[[Arrhenius Equation]]:
k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)
K = e^(-deltarxnG)/RT = ax^eq ay^eq / aA^eq aB^eq
[[Osmotic Pressure]]:
pipi = iCRT
[[Energy Distribution]]:
Activity and Chemical potential
a = gammaA* Xa where Xa could equal pA / p0 = 1 bar, gammaA is 1 in ideal conditions
muA = munaughtA+RTlna

In adiabatic conditions, no q is transferred

[[Sedimentation]]:
Fb = mdisp x arot = density of solvent x mass B x partial specific volume (the volume displaced) x arot

Fext = Fg + Fb (but they have opposite signs)
Fext = mass B x arot - density of the solvent the volume displavced , the dspeicic voume and a rot
Then, this is balanced by the frictional force - fvt (terminal velocity)

When buoyant force enters, the effective mass is reduced by 1-densityA specific volume b

s = vt/arot =mass b (1-densityAmassB) / friction

Specific volume is 1/density(of solute)!!!!

What is Raoult's Law
pvap sol = mol fraction pvap solvent
If vp solvent goes down, Bp goes up
Decrease in vp only fepends on the molecuels of solute we have


Van't Hoff Relation: dlnK / d(1/T) = -dH/R
(endothermic is downwards)

Boltzmann 
Ne^-Ei/kBT

What is the most proabable velocity
v = sqrt(2kBT/m)

kBT = 0.025eV or 2.5kJ

Clausius Chapyron
What does it do?
Find the enthalpy of phase transition
Effect of p change on boiling point
Effect of p change on melting point
Exact - dP/dt = H x 1/TV
Inexact - ln(p2/p1) = dH/R(1/T2-1/T1)

Looks similar to an endothermic vantoffs 

Confined to vapor phase equilibrium
Ln pVap vs. 1/T
What is boiling point? When pvap =pext

Henry' Law Solubillit is a proportuiiab to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution
