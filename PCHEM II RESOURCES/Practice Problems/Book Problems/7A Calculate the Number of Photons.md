**Calculate the number of photons emitted by a 100 W yellow lamp in 1.0 s. Take the wavelength of yellow light as 560 nm, and assume 100 per cent efficiency.**

Collect your thoughts Each photon has an energy hν, so the total number N of photons needed to produce an energy E is N = E/hν. To use this equation, you need to know the frequen-cy of the radiation (from ν = c/λ) and the total energy emitted by the lamp. The latter is given by the product of the power (P, in watts) and the time interval, Δt, for which the lamp is turned on: E = PΔt (see The chemist’s toolkit 8 in Topic 2A).
