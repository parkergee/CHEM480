*The [[Wavefunction]]*: All dynamical information is contained
in the wavefunction ψ for the system, which is a mathematical function found by solving the appropriate Schrödinger equation for the system.

*The [[Born Interpretation]]*: If the wavefunction of a particle has the value ψ at some position r, then the proability of finding that particle in an infinitesimal volume dtau = dxdydz at that position is proportional to |ψ|^2 dtau

Acceptable Wavefunction: The wavefunction must be single-valued, continuous, not infinite over a finite region of space, and (except in special cases) have a continous slope.

*Observables:* Represented by the [[Hermitian Operators]] built from the position and momentum operators.

*Observables and expectation values:* Observations and expectation values: A single measurement of the observable represented by the operator Ωˆ gives one of the eigenvalues of Ωˆ . If the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of Ωˆ , the average of many measurements is given by the expectation value, 〈Ω〉.

[[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]]: It is impossible to specify simultaneous, with arbitrary precision, both the linear mometum and the postion of a particle. Or, more generally, you cannot specify any part of observables of operators that DO NOT commute.
