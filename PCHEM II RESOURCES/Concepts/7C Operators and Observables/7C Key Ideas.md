While the Born interpretation provides information on the location of the particle, all other info extracted from the wavefunction comes through the use of operators and observables.

➤ Why do you need to know this material? 

To interpret the wavefunction fully it is necessary to be able to extract dynamical information from it. The predic-tions of quantum mechanics are often very different from those of classical mechanics, and those differences are essential for understanding the structures and properties of atoms and molecules.

➤ What is the key idea? 

The dynamical information in the wavefunction is extracted by calculating the expectation values of hermitian operators.

➤ What do you need to know already? 

You need to know that the state of a system is fully described by a wavefunction (Topic 7B), and that the probability density is proportional to the square modulus of the wavefunction
