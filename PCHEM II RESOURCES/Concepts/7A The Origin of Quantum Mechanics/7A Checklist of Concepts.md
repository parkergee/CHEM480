☐ 1. A black body is an object capable of emitting and absorbing all wavelengths of radiation without favour-ing any wavelength.

☐ 2. An electromagnetic field of a given frequency can take up energy only in discrete amounts.

☐ 3. Atomic and molecular spectra show that atoms and molecules can take up energy only in discrete amounts.

☐ 4. The photoelectric effect establishes the view that elec-tromagnetic radiation, regarded in classical physics as wave-like, consists of particles (photons).

☐ 5. The diffraction of electrons establishes the view that elec-trons, regarded in classical physics as particles, are wave-like with a wavelength given by the de Broglie relation.

☐ 6. Wave–particle duality is the recognition that the con-cepts of particle and wave blend together.
