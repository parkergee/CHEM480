**a). Determine and explain the sign of ΔrS**
The sign of deltaS is -, we go from 5 mols of gas to 2 mols that are a more complex molecule (lower amount of configuration / more ordered)
What is the Gibbs free energy equation that explains this?

**b). Determine and explain the sign of ΔrH. (4 pts.)**
The sign of deltaH is +, we form more stable bonds that's more ordered in the product.

**c). Determine and explain whether, from a thermodynamic standpoint, it is more favorable to run the reaction at high or low temperature. (6 pts.)**
In this situation, we consider what would happen if the reaction is at a *constant pressure.*
Knowing that, dG = Vdp - Sdt - that means we are just looking at dG = -Sdt.
But in this case, because the change in S is <0, increasing the temperature will actually make the reaction less favorable. So it would be best to run this reaction at low temperature.

[[Gibbs Free Energy 1]]

**d). Determine and explain whether, from a thermodynamic standpoint, it is more favorable to run the reaction at high or low pressure. (6 pts.)**
In this situation, we consider what would happen if the reaction is at a constant temperature.
Knowing that, dG = Vdp
We know that the sign of deltaH is positive
Since we are dealing with gases, we replace V with deltanRT (which is a constant!)
The delta, nRT is -, so that would mean we want this to be at a higher pressure!

**e). Determine and explain whether, from a kinetic standpoint, it is more favorable to run the reaction at high or low temperature. (6 pts.)**
Examining the [[Arrehenius Equation]], we see that when we increase the T the - exp becomes smaller / less negative. Which, would mean that k becomes larger.

(As a reminder!)

**f). Determine and explain whether, from a kinetic standpoint, it is more favorable to run the reaction at high or low total pressure. (6 pts.)**
It is more favorable to run the reaction at higher pressure.
p = n/V(RT), if p is higher, equivalent to having n being higher! 

**g).Given that platinum is a good catalyst for the reaction, state the role of platinum in the thermodynamics of the reaction. (4 pts.)**
The catalyst does NOT have a role in the thermodynamics of the reaction, it does not affect K as it is neither in the products or the reactants.

**h). Given that platinum is a good catalyst for the reaction, state the role of platinum in the kinetics of the reaction. (4 pts.)**
The catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by either stabilizing the transition state or by leading to a more favorable mechanism of the reaction 

**3i). Give the formal global order of the rate law (explain how you reach that value). (4 pts.)**
The global order of the rate law would be: 
1+2-1 = 2

**j). Explain from a thermodynamics standpoint whether it is favorable or unfavorable to remove some XY4 from the reaction vessel. (4 pts.)**
[[Le Chateliers]]
It is thermodynamically favorable for XY4 to be removed from the reaction vessel.
When examing the equilibrium constant: K = [XY4]^2 / X2Y2^4, when remove XY4 - the system will shift to return to equilibrium - which will lead to an increase in product production. The position of the equilibrium shifts to counteract the change!

**k). Explain from a kinetics standpoint whether it is favorable or unfavorable to remove some XY4 from the reaction vessel. (4 pts.)**
It is kinetically favorable for XY4 to be removed. Looking at the rate law, we see that removing XY4 would increase the overall rate due to the negative exponent. (Will have less of a negative impact on the overall rate law equation)
