 Suggested that any particle, not only photons, trav-elling with a linear momentum p = mv (with m the mass and v the speed of the particle) should have in some sense a wavelength.

- Particles with high linear momentum have a short wavelength. 
- Macroscopic bodies have large momenta therefore their wavelengths are undetectibly small!
