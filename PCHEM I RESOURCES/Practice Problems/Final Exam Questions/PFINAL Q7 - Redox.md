**7. A physical chemist is interested in building a galvanic electrochemical cell based on the
following redox couples involving rhenium and manganese:
Re3+ + 3 e- ⇄ Re E0 = +0.3 V
Mn2+ + 2 e- ⇄ Mn E0 = -1.2 V
Note, the more + it is the more it wants to be reduced, - more oxidized

How to do a problem like this?
1) Find the species that wants to be oxidized (the more -), FLIP ITT!! to +...
2)  Ensure that the same # of e will be transferred (DO NOT MULTIPLY V!!!)
3) Ox + Re = V total!!!

a). Write the balanced chemical reaction in such a way that it goes spontaneously from reactants to products under standard conditions. (8 pts.)**
Mn <> Mn2+ + 2 e- (x3)
Re3+ + 3e- <> Re (x2)
3Mn + 2Re3+ +6e- <> 3Mn2+ +6e- + 2Re

**b).Determine the value of the standard electrochemical potential for the reaction you have written in part a). (6 pts.)**
1.2V + 0.3V = 1.5V??? (Yes)
**c). Determine the approximate value of the equilibrium constant at room temperature for the reaction you have written in part a). Make sure to express the final result in powers of 10.**
Ev = kBT/ve ln K, ve = 6?
