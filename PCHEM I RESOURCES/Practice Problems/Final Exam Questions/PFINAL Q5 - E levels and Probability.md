**5. Consider a system made of four sub-systems that are in thermal equilibrium. Each subsystem has 5 non-degenerate energy levels with quantized energies:
 E0 = 0; E1 = ε; E2 = 3ε; E3 = 4ε; and E4 = 6ε. Sketch the energy levels of the four subsystems and illustrate the energy distribution that is the least probable. (8 pts.)
 [[PS5 Q4 - Total E - States and Q]] [[PSS 5 Q1 - Finding Q]] [[E3 Q3 - Two-level System, Finding Q]]

I'm going to assume you find the probability of each occuring?
So, you would use the following equation...
Actually find the average E and see how the particles can be distributed in that fashion. The average E is 4, how can that be distributed across the levels???


**b). Sketch the energy levels of the four subsystems and illustrate an example of the energy distribution that is the most probable. (8 pts.)**
