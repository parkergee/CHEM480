Your answer:
(a) The magnitude is just: 
sqrt(z x zstar)...
No! c = a + ib!
IzI = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
What is a, and what is b then?
a = 2 
b = 3

What is z then?
z = sqrt (4+9)
z = sqrt(13)

Correct!

(b) The complex conjugate, zstar = 2 - 3i

(c) sqrt(zstar x z)
(2+3i)(2-3i) = 15
sqrt(zstar x z) = sqrt(15)

Correct!
