A body that emits and absorbs electromagnetic radiations withour favoring any wavelengths.

Small hole in empty container.

All objects emit [[Electromagnetic Radiation]] that depends on the temperature of the object.

The energy density, E(T), is the total energy inside the con-tainer divided by its volume. The energy spectral density, ρ(λ,T), is defined so that ρ(λ,T)dλ is the energy density at temperature T due to the presence of electromagnetic radia-tion with wavelengths between λ and λ + dλ. 
This leads to the ultraviolet catastrophe:

Idea you can have infinite energy with infinite small wavelengths.

Every oscillator, regardless of its frequency has an average energy of kT.

In 1900, Max Planck found that the experimentally observed intensity distribution of black-body radiation could be explained by proposing that the energy of each oscillator is limited to discrete values. In particular, Planck assumed that for an electromagnetic oscillator of frequency ν, the permitted energies are integer multiples of h v. Where h is Plank's constant.
