Boltzmann distribution
At equlibrium, state of an isolated system is one that represents the most favorable distribution and has maximum randomness (most probable)

Pr = Ni / N = (e^-Ei/kBT) / (Z e^(-Ei/kBT))

Molecular partition function Q:
(e^-Ei/kBT), is a function of the T and E levels of the molecule!

g = degeneracy, 2 for p level (-1)

Finding K using Redox terms (NERNST)
The concentration dependence of E
At equil, E is zero:
Ev = kBT/ve ln K
