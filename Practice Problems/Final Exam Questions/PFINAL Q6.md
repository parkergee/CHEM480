**6. A biochemist has put in solution a protein with a very high molecular weight. The protein starts sedimenting.**

**a). Explain in words and illustrate with a drawing each of the 3 forces that act on the protein as it slowly moves towards the bottom of the flask with a terminal velocity. Gives the expression of each force and how they compensate each other. (12 pts.)**
**b). Explain whether you expect the protein to sediment more quickly or more slowly if its shape goes from a spherical shape (soccer ball-like) to a prolate shape (American football-like). (4 pts.)**
