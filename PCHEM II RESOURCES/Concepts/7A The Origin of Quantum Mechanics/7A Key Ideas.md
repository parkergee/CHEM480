➤ Why do you need to know this material? Quantum theory is central to almost every explanation in chemistry. It is used to understand atomic and molecular structure, chemical bonds, and most of the properties of matter.

➤ What is the key idea? Experimental evidence led to the conclusion that energy can be transferred only in discrete amounts, and that the classical concepts of a ‘particle’ and a ‘wave’ blend together.

➤ What do you need to know already? You should be familiar with the basic principles of classical mechanics, especially momentum, force, and energy set out in The chemist’s toolkits 3 (in Topic 1B) and 6 (in Topic 2A). The discussion of heat 

Checklist of Concepts!
☐ 1. A black body is an object capable of emitting and absorbing all wavelengths of radiation without favour-ing any wavelength.
☐ 2. An electromagnetic field of a given frequency can take up energy only in discrete amounts.
☐ 3. Atomic and molecular spectra show that atoms and molecules can take up energy only in discrete amounts.
☐ 4. The photoelectric effect establishes the view that elec-tromagnetic radiation, regarded in classical physics as wave-like, consists of particles (photons).
☐ 5. The diffraction of electrons establishes the view that elec-trons, regarded in classical physics as particles, are wave-like with a wavelength given by the de Broglie relation.
☐ 6. Wave–particle duality is the recognition that the concepts of particle and wave blend together
