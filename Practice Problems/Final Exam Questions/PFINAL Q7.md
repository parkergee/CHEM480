**7. A physical chemist is interested in building a galvanic electrochemical cell based on the
following redox couples involving rhenium and manganese:
Re3+ + 3 e- ⇄ Re E0 = +0.3 V
Mn2+ + 2 e- ⇄ Mn E0 = -1.2 V
a). Write the balanced chemical reaction in such a way that it goes spontaneously from reactants to products under standard conditions. (8 pts.)**

**b).Determine the value of the standard electrochemical potential for the reaction you have written in part a). (6 pts.)**

**c). Determine the approximate value of the equilibrium constant at room temperature for the reaction you have written in part a). Make sure to express the final result in powers of 10.**
