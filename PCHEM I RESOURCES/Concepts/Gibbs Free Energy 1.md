Tells us the spontaneity of a reaction.
G = H-TS
Where H = U + PV
Where dU = dqrev + dwrev
dqrev = TdS
[[Entropy]]
dwrev = -pdV

When combined together.
dG = Vdp - Sdt
Therefore, p and T are the natural variables of G.
Critically, V can be replaced with deltanRT when looking for pressure!
Best suited for transformations at constant pressure or temperature.
