**A photon of radiation of wavelength 305 nm ejects an electron with a kinetic energy of 1.77 eV from a metal. Calculate the longest wavelength of radiation capable of ejecting an electron from the metal.**

Collect your thoughts You can use eqn 7A.10, rearranged into Φ = hν − Ek
, to compute the work function because you know
the frequency of the photon from ν = c/λ. The threshold for photoejection is the lowest frequency at which electron ejec-tion occurs without there being any excess energy; that is, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is zero. Setting Ek Ek = hν − Φ gives the minimum photon frequency as νmin.

The solution The minimum frequency for photoejection is:
