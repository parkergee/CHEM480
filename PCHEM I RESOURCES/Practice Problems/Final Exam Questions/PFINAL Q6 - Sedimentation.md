**6. A biochemist has put in solution a protein with a very high molecular weight. The protein starts sedimenting.**

**a). Explain in words and illustrate with a drawing each of the 3 forces that act on the protein as it slowly moves towards the bottom of the flask with a terminal velocity. Gives the expression of each force and how they compensate each other. (12 pts.)**

The frictional force = Ff = - Fext = fvt
The gravitational force Fg = mg
The bouyancy force = Fb = - Fext = -mg vb qa

Total flux is zero = Jext + JD = 0
D = kBT / f
f = 6pinnr
nn = viscocity, the ability for a medium to flow

**b). Explain whether you expect the protein to sediment more quickly or more slowly if its shape goes from a spherical shape (soccer ball-like) to a prolate shape (American football-like). (4 pts.)**

You would expect it to sediment mroe slowly, it's Ff would be larger as there is increased surface area n contact with the solvent - ie more intermolecular interactions that could slow the rate to terminal velocity
