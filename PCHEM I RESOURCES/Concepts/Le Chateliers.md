Le Chatelier's principle states that if a **dynamic equilibrium** is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium shifts to counteract the change to reestablish an equilibrium. 

If a chemical reaction is at equilibrium and experiences a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of products or reactants, the equilibrium shifts in the opposite direction to offset the change.
