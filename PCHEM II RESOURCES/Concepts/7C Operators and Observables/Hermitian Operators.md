All quantum mechanical operators are Hermitian.

How to interpret:
The position operator (x x) is hermitian because in this case the order of the factors in the integrand can be changed. (See below)

Why is this important? Hermitian eigenvalues are real!
omega* = omega. Position, momentum, energy CANNOT be complex or imaginary. 

An operator that represent an observable MUST be hermitian.

The hamiltonian operator is hermitian , if two of its eigenfunctions correspond to different energirs - the two functions must be orthoganal.
