**11. Consider the 4 reversible steps of the Carnot cycle for a steam engine.
For each step (no explanations needed!): (i) state the nature of the transformation (in just two words); (ii) indicate whether the engine transfers heat to the surroundings [q<0], or gains heat from the surroundings [q>0], or whether there is no heat transfer [q=0]; (iii) indicate whether the engine does pV work against the surroundings [w<0], or the surroundings does work on the engine [w>0], or whether no work is involved [w=0]; and (iv) indicate whether the engine is connected to a cold heat reservoir, or to a hot heat reservoir, or is not connected to any heat reservoir.

So it's a PV diagram!
**Step 1:**

**nature of transformation: Isothermal expansion
q: w
w: nRThot(ln(V2/V1))
connected to any heat reservoir?** yes, heat reservoir

**Step 2:
nature of transformation: Adiabatic expansion
q: 0
w: nR ln (V2/V3)
connected to any heat reservoir?** no

**Step 3:
nature of transformation: Isothermal compression
q:  -w
w: nRTcold(ln(V4/V3))
connected to any heat reservoir?** yes, cold reservoir

**Step 4:
nature of transformation: Adiabatic compression
q: 0
w: nR ln (V2/V3)
connected to any heat reservoir? no**

What is the efficiency of the Carnot Cycle? 1 - Tcold/Thot
How did we get this?
The total work of the cycle is just w1-w3 -> 
q1 + q3 = 0
q1 / Thot + q3 / Tcold
E = 1 + q3/q1
E = 1 -Tcold/Thot
