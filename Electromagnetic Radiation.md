Electromagnetic radiation consists of oscillating electric and magnetic disturbances that propagate as waves. The two com-ponents of an electromagnetic wave are mutually perpendicu-lar and are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Sketch 1). Electromagnetic waves travel through a vacuum at a constant speed called the speed of light, c, which has the defined value of exactly 2.997 924 58 × 108
m s−1

A wave is characterized by its wavelength, λ (lambda), the
distance between consecutive peaks of the wave (Sketch 2). The classification of electromagnetic radiation according to its wavelength is shown in Sketch 3. Light, which is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye, has a wavelength in the range 420 nm (violet light) to 700 nm (red light). The properties of a wave may also be expressed in terms of its frequency, ν (nu), the number of oscillations in a time interval divided by the duration of the interval. Frequency is reported in hertz, Hz, with 1 Hz = 1 s−

Wavenumber 

Thus, wavenumber is the reciprocal of the wavelength and can be interpreted as the number of wavelengths in a given distance. In spectroscopy, for historical reasons, wavenumber is usually reported in units of reciprocal centimetres (cm−1) where their displacements subtract (Sketch 4). 

The formeris called ‘constructive interference’ and the latter ‘destruc-tive interference’. The regions of constructive and destructive interference show up as regions of enhanced and diminished intensity. The phenomenon of diffraction is the interference caused by an object in the path of waves and occurs when the dimensions of the object are comparable to the wavelength of the radiation. Light waves, with wavelengths of the order of 500 nm, are diffracted by narrow slits.

Visible light therefore corresponds to electromagnetic radia-tion with a wavenumber of 14 000 cm−1
(red light) to 24 000 cm−1
(violet light). Electromagnetic radiation that consists of a single frequency
(and therefore single wavelength) is monochromatic, because it corresponds to a single colour. White light consists of elec-tromagnetic waves with a continuous, but not uniform, spread of frequencies throughout the visible region of the spectrum. A characteristic property of waves is that they interfere with
one another, which means that they result in a greater ampli-tude where their displacements add and a smaller amplitud
